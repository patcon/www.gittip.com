*** WARNING ***
CRLF detected. You must fix the line endings manually before continuing.

PROBLEM
Vagrant syncs your working directory with Ubuntu. Scripts and the Makefile
expect Unix line endings, but git converts them to Windows CRLF with autocrlf.

SOLUTION
1. git stash               # Stash your work
2. git rm --cached -r .    # Remove everything from the index
3. git reset --hard        # Remove the index and working directory from git

Run "vagrant provision" again afterward to continue.
